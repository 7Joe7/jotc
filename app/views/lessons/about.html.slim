  p.question What is this site?
  p This site is a helper to my teaching activities. It is the lessons supporting subsection of #{link_to 'JOT website', root_path}.
    You may see what that is about #{link_to 'here', crossroads_about_path}.
  / You may find here under reservations my synchronised
    calendar where you may set a meeting very efficiently. Under Chess you may find topical tactics tasks and some
    famous games with commentary. There is also a price-list for private lessons. List of links I find very interesting.
